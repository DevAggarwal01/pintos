Teammates: Dev Aggarwal, Hrutvik Rao Palutla Venkata

Just like the last project, I (Dev) will give a general overview of our workflow and division of effort.

We both spent a lot of time on this project together—mostly pair programming or over late-night calls debugging the more complex system call and process synchronization logic.

Hrutvik focused heavily on the argument passing and synchronization issues. Meanwhile, I focused on system calls.

We worked together to design the process synchronization logic. I helped design and test the child_record structure and wrote much of the parent–child synchronization and exit handling code. I also worked on the file descriptor table logic (fd_entry creation, lookup, and cleanup) and verified concurrency safety with file_lock.

Once our system calls were passing most tests, Hrutvik focused on refining edge cases and ensuring robust error handling, while I cleaned up the code, organized the structs, and wrote detailed comments and parts of the design document. We both reviewed each other’s sections and did final testing together.

Total Hours Spent: ~14–15 hours each
